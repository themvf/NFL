Enhanced Receiving Yards & TD Projections with DFS Scoring

This module provides advanced player projections that incorporate:
- Defense-adjusted team projections (60% offense, 40% defense)
- Recency-weighted target shares (70% last 4 games, 30% season)
- Position-specific defensive matchups (WR vs TE vulnerabilities)
- Air Yards vs YAC style matchup multipliers
- TD probability modeling (red zone targets, team efficiency, defensive vulnerability)
- Comprehensive DFS scoring (0-100 scale)
